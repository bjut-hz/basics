 * Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover
 * the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are
 * not.
 * 
 * You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two
 * nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
 * Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 
 * Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
 * ⁠         1                         2                             
 * ⁠        / \                       / \                            
 * ⁠       3   2                     1   3                        
 * ⁠      /                           \   \                      
 * ⁠     5                             4   7                  
 * Output: 
 * Merged tree:
 * 3
 * / \
 * 4   5
 * / \   \ 
 * 5   4   7
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.
